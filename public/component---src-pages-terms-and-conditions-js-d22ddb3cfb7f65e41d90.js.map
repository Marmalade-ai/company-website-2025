We offer free and paid products and hope you will \n    purchase one of our paid product. We don't sell your data.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Who We Are</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Marmalade AI products are provided by Marmalade AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation. \n    For more information about Marmalade AI, please visit https://www.marmalade.ai/about.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Paid Accounts</h2>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Billing</i>: You can upgrade your account to access paid features, which would turn your \n    account into a paid account. When you do that, we'll automatically bill you from the date \n    you convert to a paid account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. \n    You are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required. \n    Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and \n    this paragraph doesn't override these laws.</p>\n    <br/>\n<p><i>Refunds</i>: You may cancel your Marmalade AI paid account at any time (instructions on how \nto do that are [TBD] <b>here</b>). Refunds are issued if they are required by law.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Downgrades</i>: Your paid account will remain in effect until it's canceled or terminated \nunder these terms. If you don't pay for your paid account on time, we reserve the right to \nsuspend it or reduce your access to the free version of our products.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Free trials</i>: Marmalade AI may offer a free trial membership. If you are using a free trial \nmembership and cancel it before the end of the trial period, all your rights to any remaining \nfree trial period will end. Typically, we will only offer one free \ntrial per user.</p> \n<br/>\n<p><i>Changes</i>: We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice before \nthose changes take effect. Any change in prices will apply to your next billing cycle.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Your Ownership of Your Data and the Limited Permissions You Give Us</h2>\n<br/>\n<p><b>User Content</b> refers to the text and documents you enter, upload, and transmit when \nyou use our products.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>You own your User Content; Marmalade AI doesn't own it. To provide our products to you, we need your \npermission (in legal language, a license) to use your User Content.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>You grant us a license to your User Content for the limited purposes of:</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x2713; Operating, providing, improving, troubleshooting, and debugging our products (for example, \nyour User Content may help train our suggestion engine);</li>\n<li>&#x2713; Protecting our products (for example, to analyze patterns in usage to prevent abuse);</li>\n<li>&#x2713; Customizing our products (for example, to create personalized suggestions for you);</li>\n<li>&#x2713; Developing new products or features; and</li>\n<li>&#x2713; Using information you upload or provide to us (such as your name) to encourage other \n    people in your organization or network to join Marmalade AI.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The license you give us is only for the above purposes. That means we will not, for example, sell \nor license your User Content to third-party data brokers.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The license you grant us is:\n<ul>\n<li>&#x2713; Worldwide (so you can access your User Content from anywhere in the world);</li>\n<li>&#x2713; Non-exclusive (meaning you own your User Content and can also license it to other people \n    or companies);</li>\n<li>&#x2713; Royalty-free (meaning we don't pay you for it); and</li>\n<li>&#x2713; For as long as intellectual property laws protect your User Content.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<br/>\n<p>The license you give us allows us to—solely for the purposes outlined above—store, reproduce,\n    use, publish, and publicly display (to show your User Content to you), modify, and create \n    derivative works of (such as providing writing suggestions and autocorrecting words) your \n    User Content. The license you give us also permits our service providers to assist us in \n    doing this. </p>\n    <br/>\n<p>Marmalade AI does not own, control, verify, or endorse User Content. You are responsible for \n    all of your User Content. That means you should back up all your User Content and not do \n    anything illegal or harmful with it (including violate any intellectual property or \n    trade secret laws).</p>\n    <br/>\n<h2>Our Intellectual Property Rights and License to You</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Some of our products allow you to download client software.

You may use generative AI features to submit inputs and receive generated outputs. \nWhen you use generative AI features, the inputs and outputs are your User Data. You are responsible \nfor your User Data and will not use Marmalade AI's generative AI features in a way that infringes, \nviolates, or misappropriates any of our rights or the rights of any third party. You acknowledge \nthat due to the nature of machine learning and the technology powering generative AI, outputs may \nnot be unique and Marmalade AI may generate the same or similar output for third parties.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n<i>Usage Limits</i>. Depending on your subscription plan, you may have a limit on your use of \nMarmalade AI's generative AI features. You acknowledge and agree that if you exceed the usage limit \nallotted by your subscription plan: (i) you may be required to purchase additional usage to continue \naccessing and using generative AI assistance and (ii) Marmalade AI may suspend or degrade performance \nof the generative AI features. You acknowledge that any purchased usage for generative AI assistance \nis tied to your Marmalade AI subscription plan, and account termination will invalidate any remaining \npurchased usage.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>\n<i>Usage Restrictions</i>. You may not use Marmalade AI's generative AI features:\n<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x2713; To develop foundation or large language models that compete with Marmalade AI;</li> \n<li>&#x2713; To mislead any third party that any output from Marmalade AI's generative AI was solely human generated;</li>\n<li>&#x2713; In a manner that violates these terms, Marmalade AI documentation, usage guidelines, or our Acceptable \nUse Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h2>Limitations on Use and Responsibilities</h2>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Acceptable Use Policy</i>. You must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy when you use our products.</p> \n<br/>\n<p><i>Keeping your account information up to date and safe</i>. You are responsible for safeguarding your \npassword to our products. Don't share your account credentials or give others access to your account. \nWe will use your account email address to contact you about our products, so you must ensure that your \naccount information stays current.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Minimum age requirements</i>. To use our products, you must be at least 13 if you reside in the United \nStates and 16 if you reside anywhere else. If the law where you reside requires that you are older \nfor us to lawfully provide our products to you without parental consent (including using your \ninformation), you must be that age. You may not use our products if you don't meet these age \nrequirements. However, if your parents or guardians have allowed you to join a Marmalade AI for \nEducation team, you may still use our products.</p> \n<br/>\n<h2>Termination</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our products with notice to \n    you if:</p>\n    <br/>\n<p>(a) you have breached these terms or our Acceptable Use Policy,</p>\n<p>(b) you use the products in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to other \nMarmalade AI users or us, or</p>\n<p>(c) you don't have a paid account and haven't accessed our products for 12 consecutive months.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Before suspending or terminating your account, we'll (1) provide you with reasonable advance \n    notice via the email address associated with your account so you can try to remedy the activity \n    that prompted us to contact you and (2) allow you to export your documents from our products. If \n    you fail to take the steps we ask of you after such notice, we'll terminate or suspend your access \n    to our products.</p>\n    <br/>\n<p>We won't provide notice before termination where we believe that:</p>\n<br/>\n<p>(a) you're in material breach of these terms or our Acceptable Use Policy,</p>\n<p>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide our products to our \nother users, or</p>\n<p>(c) the law prohibits us from providing notice.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>When this agreement terminates for any reason, all the sections one would expect to survive will \n    survive, including, but not limited to, “Warranty Disclaimers,” “Limitation of Liability,” \n    Resolving Disputes,” “Miscellaneous Legal Terms,” “Our Intellectual Property Rights and License,” \n    and “Paid Accounts.” The termination of this agreement doesn't affect any amounts owed before that \n    termination. </p>\n    <br/>\n<h2>Discontinuation and Modification of Products</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>We are continually changing and improving our products, and we may add or remove features or \n    functionality. If we discontinue a product, where reasonably possible we will give you reasonable \n    advance notice and a chance to download your stored User Content.</p>\n    <br/>\n<h2>Open Source Software, Reverse Engineering, and Automatic Updates</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>To the extent any component of our Software may be offered under open-source license terms that \n    we make available to you, see [<b>TBD</b>] here for a list of the open-source software that we use. The \n    provisions of open-source licenses may expressly override some of these terms. </p>\n    <br/>\n<p>Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or \ndecompile our products, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so. Our products may update \nthemselves automatically to ensure you're using the latest version.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Any links to third-party websites or apps are provided for your convenience only and are subject to \nthe third party's terms. Marmalade AI isn't responsible or liable for those websites, products, or \nservices.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Beta Products</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. We will mark \nthese products with the words “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or \nphrases with similar meanings). If you decide to use them, please remember that they may not be as \nreliable or as thoroughly tested as our other products. To improve and evaluate these products, we \nwill log and analyze information about how you use and interact with them.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Warranty Disclaimers</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Marmalade AI, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS \n    AND DISTRIBUTORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “Marmalade AI ENTITIES”), EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL \n    WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, \n    ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A \n    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, \n    LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, OR REGARDING SECURITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND \n    PERFORMANCE. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN SOLE RISK AND THAT OUR PRODUCTS \n    ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS,” “WHERE IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES \n    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES \n    DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF OUR PRODUCTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED \n    OR ERROR-FREE. Marmalade AI'S AFFILIATES AND THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES' SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND \n    DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS SECTION.</p>\n    <br/>\n<p>THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING THE OUTPUTS THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM USE \nOF GENERATIVE AI FEATURES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FACTUAL ACCURACY OF ANY OUTPUTS OR SUITABILITY \nFOR YOUR USE CASE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF ANY GENERATIVE AI OUTPUTS IS DONE AT YOUR \nSOLE RISK. DUE TO THE NATURE OF GENERATIVE TECHNOLOGY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON Marmalade AI'S \nGENERATIVE AI AS A SINGLE SOURCE OF FACTUAL INFORMATION. NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE, WHETHER ORAL OR \nWRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM OR THROUGH Marmalade AI SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE \nHEREIN.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS ARE ALLOWED, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES \n    BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS FOR (I) ANY AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE FEES \n    YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID TO THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY \n    PRECEDING THE EVENT(S) GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; (II) ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST OR DAMAGED \n    CONTENT OR OTHER DATA, OR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION GOOD FAITH AND \n    REASONABLE CARE; OR (III) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL \n    DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER.</p>\n    <br/>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND IS A \nFUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Marmalade AI AND YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT \nOUR PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Certain countries and states don't allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this \n    limitation of liability may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights. In that case, \n    you agree that the Marmalade AI Entities' liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible \n    in your country of residence.</p>\n    <br/>\n<p>IF ANY PORTION OF THESE SECTIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION SHALL NOT \nAFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THESE TERMS. Marmalade AI'S AFFILIATES AND THE \nMarmalade AI ENTITIES' SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF \nHIS SECTION.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Before filing a claim against Marmalade AI, you agree to try \n    to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href=\"mailto:support@marmalade.ai\">support@marmalade.ai</a>. \n    We'll try to resolve \n    the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If you and we cannot resolve the dispute \n    informally, then a party seeking to bring a formal proceeding must first send to the other, by \n    certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Marmalade AI should be sent \n    to 10 Dobbs St, Bernardsville, NJ 07924, Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must \n    (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief \n    sought. If Marmalade AI and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after \n    receiving the Notice, you or Marmalade AI may commence a formal proceeding. </p>\n    <br/>\n<p>Judicial forum for disputes. You and Marmalade AI agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims \nrelating to these terms for our products will be brought in the federal or state courts of Somerset  \nCounty, New Jersey, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Marmalade AI \nconsent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country with laws that \ngive consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member \nstates), this paragraph doesn't affect those requirements.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>IF YOU'RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h3>\n<br/>\n<p><i>We both agree to arbitrate</i>. You and Marmalade AI agree to resolve any claims relating to these terms \nor our products through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth \nunder “Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate” below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating \nto interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its \nenforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Opt-out of agreement to arbitrate</i>. You have the right to opt out of these arbitration provisions (and \nany future changes to arbitration provisions) by emailing [<b>TBD</b>] arbitration-opt-out@marmalade.ai within \n30 days of agreeing to a version of these terms containing arbitration terms (however, if you agreed \nto a previous version of these terms of service that contain an arbitration provision, you are still \nbound by those arbitration provisions).</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Arbitration procedures</i>. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under \nits Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The \narbitration will be held in Somerset County, New Jersey, or any other location we agree to. During \nthe arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Marmalade AI or you shall not be disclosed \nto the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Marmalade AI \nis entitled.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Arbitration fees and incentives</i>. The AAA rules will govern the payment of all arbitration fees. \nMarmalade AI will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for non-frivolous claims less \nthan $75,000. Marmalade AI will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the \narbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate</i>. Either you or Marmalade AI may assert claims, if they qualify, in \nsmall claims court in Somerset County, New Jersey, or any United States county where you live or \nwork. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse \nof the products or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, \nor patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process \ndescribed above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree \nto the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Somerset County, New Jersey, \nto resolve your claim.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</h3> \n<br/>\n<p>You may only resolve disputes with us individually. That is, you may not \nbring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. \nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other \narbitrations aren't allowed.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Severability</i>. If the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \n“Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be deemed void. If you are found to have a non-waivable \nright to bring a specific claim or request a specific form of relief that an arbitrator lacks the \nauthority to redress or award under this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including public \ninjunctive relief, then only that particular claim or request may be brought in court, and you and we \nagree that litigation of this claim or request will be stayed pending the resolution of any other \nclaims or requests for relief in arbitration.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Controlling Law</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>New Jersey law will govern these terms except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some \ncountries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by \nthe local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h2>\n<br/>\n<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>These terms make up the entire agreement between you and Marmalade AI, Inc., regarding your use of \nour products. They supersede any prior agreements.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Waiver, Severability, and Assignment</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>Marmalade AI's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a \nprovision (other than the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” paragraph) is unenforceable, the remaining provisions \nwill remain in full effect, and an enforceable term will be substituted with the goal of reflecting \nour intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these \nterms, and any such attempt will be void. Marmalade AI may assign its rights to any of its affiliates \nor subsidiaries or any successor in interest of any business associated with the products.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Modifications to These Terms</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>From time to time, we may revise these terms to, for example, reflect changes to the law, new \nregulations, and changes to our products.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>If an update significantly negatively affects your use of our products or your legal rights as a user \nof our products, we'll notify you before the update's effective date by sending an email to the email \naddress associated with your account or via an in-product notification. We will give you at least 30 \ndays after that notice before the update takes effect. </p>\n<br/>\n<p>We may also update these terms in ways that won't significantly negatively affect your rights. For \nexample, we may change the feature or product names or change the email address you can use to \ncontact us. In those cases, we will post the change to our website and link to the previous version. </p>\n<br/>\n<p>If you don't agree to the updates we make, you must cancel your account before they become effective. \nWhere required, we'll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for our \nproducts and your account cancellation date. By using or accessing the products after the updates \ncome into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h2>Contact Information</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>\nIf you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, the practices of\nthis site, or your dealings with this site, you can send email to \n<a href=\"mailto:terms@marmalade.ai\">terms@marmalade.ai</a>\n</p>\n\n</div>\n</article>\n</main>\n</Layout>\n);\n}\n\nexport default TermsAndConditions;\n\n"],"names":["Head","lang","charSet","name","content","className","dateTime","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
