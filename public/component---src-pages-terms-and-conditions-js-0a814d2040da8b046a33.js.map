YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF ANY GENERATIVE AI OUTPUTS IS DONE AT YOUR \nSOLE RISK. DUE TO THE NATURE OF GENERATIVE TECHNOLOGY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON Marmalade AI&apos;S \nGENERATIVE AI AS A SINGLE SOURCE OF FACTUAL INFORMATION.

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT \nOUR PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>Certain countries and states don&apos;t allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this \n    limitation of liability may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights. In that case, \n    you agree that the Marmalade AI Entities&apos; liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible \n    in your country of residence.</p>\n    <br/>\n<p>IF ANY PORTION OF THESE SECTIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION SHALL NOT \nAFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THESE TERMS. Marmalade AI&apos;S AFFILIATES AND THE \nMarmalade AI ENTITIES&apos; SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF \nHIS SECTION.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>Before filing a claim against Marmalade AI, you agree to try \n    to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href=\"mailto:support@marmalade.ai\">support@marmalade.ai</a>. \n    We&apos;ll try to resolve \n    the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If you and we cannot resolve the dispute \n    informally, then a party seeking to bring a formal proceeding must first send to the other, by \n    certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (âNoticeâ). The Notice to Marmalade AI should be sent \n    to 10 Dobbs St, Bernardsville, NJ 07924, Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must \n    (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief \n    sought. If Marmalade AI and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after \n    receiving the Notice, you or Marmalade AI may commence a formal proceeding. </p>\n    <br/>\n<p>Judicial forum for disputes. You and Marmalade AI agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims \nrelating to these terms for our products will be brought in the federal or state courts of Somerset  \nCounty, New Jersey, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Marmalade AI \nconsent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country with laws that \ngive consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member \nstates), this paragraph doesn&apos;t affect those requirements.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>IF YOU&apos;RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h3>\n<br/>\n<p><i>We both agree to arbitrate</i>. You and Marmalade AI agree to resolve any claims relating to these terms \nor our products through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth \nunder âExceptions to agreement to arbitrateâ below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating \nto interpretation or application of this âMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ section, including its \nenforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Opt-out of agreement to arbitrate</i>. You have the right to opt out of these arbitration provisions (and \nany future changes to arbitration provisions) by \nemailing <a href=\"mailto:arbitration-opt-out@marmalade.ai\">arbitration-opt-out@marmalade.ai</a> within \n30 days of agreeing to a version of these terms containing arbitration terms (however, if you agreed \nto a previous version of these terms of service that contain an arbitration provision, you are still \nbound by those arbitration provisions).</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Arbitration procedures</i>. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under \nits Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The \narbitration will be held in Somerset County, New Jersey, or any other location we agree to. During \nthe arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Marmalade AI or you shall not be disclosed \nto the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Marmalade AI \nis entitled.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Arbitration fees and incentives</i>. The AAA rules will govern the payment of all arbitration fees. \nMarmalade AI will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for non-frivolous claims less \nthan $75,000. Marmalade AI will not seek its attorneys&apos; fees and costs in arbitration unless the \narbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate</i>. Either you or Marmalade AI may assert claims, if they qualify, in \nsmall claims court in Somerset County, New Jersey, or any United States county where you live or \nwork. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse \nof the products or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, \nor patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process \ndescribed above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree \nto the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Somerset County, New Jersey, \nto resolve your claim.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</h3> \n<br/>\n<p>You may only resolve disputes with us individually. That is, you may not \nbring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. \nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other \narbitrations aren&apos;t allowed.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><i>Severability</i>. If the âNO CLASS ACTIONSâ paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \nâMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ section will be deemed void. If you are found to have a non-waivable \nright to bring a specific claim or request a specific form of relief that an arbitrator lacks the \nauthority to redress or award under this âMandatory Arbitration Provisionsâ section, including public \ninjunctive relief, then only that particular claim or request may be brought in court, and you and we \nagree that litigation of this claim or request will be stayed pending the resolution of any other \nclaims or requests for relief in arbitration.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Controlling Law</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>New Jersey law will govern these terms except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some \ncountries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by \nthe local laws of the consumer&apos;s country. This paragraph doesn&apos;t override those laws.</p>\n<br/>\n<h2>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h2>\n<br/>\n<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>These terms make up the entire agreement between you and Marmalade AI regarding your use of \nour products. They supersede any prior agreements.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Waiver, Severability, and Assignment</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>Marmalade AI&apos;s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a \nprovision (other than the âNO CLASS ACTIONSâ paragraph) is unenforceable, the remaining provisions \nwill remain in full effect, and an enforceable term will be substituted with the goal of reflecting \nour intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these \nterms, and any such attempt will be void. Marmalade AI may assign its rights to any of its affiliates \nor subsidiaries or any successor in interest of any business associated with the products.</p>\n<br/>\n<h3>Modifications to These Terms</h3>\n<br/>\n<p>From time to time, we may revise these terms to, for example, reflect changes to the law, new \nregulations, and changes to our products.</p>\n<br/>\n<p>If an update significantly negatively affects your use of our products or your legal rights as a user \nof our products, we&apos;ll notify you before the update&apos;s effective date by sending an email to the email \naddress associated with your account or via an in-product notification. We will give you at least 30 \ndays after that notice before the update takes effect. </p>\n<br/>\n<p>We may also update these terms in ways that won&apos;t significantly negatively affect your rights. For \nexample, we may change the feature or product names or change the email address you can use to \ncontact us. In those cases, we will post the change to our website and link to the previous version. </p>\n<br/>\n<p>If you don&apos;t agree to the updates we make, you must cancel your account before they become effective. \nWhere required, we&apos;ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for our \nproducts and your account cancellation date. By using or accessing the products after the updates \ncome into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>\n<br/>\n\n<h2>Contact Information</h2>\n<br/>\n<p>\nIf you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, the practices of\nthis site, or your dealings with this site, you can send email \nto <a href=\"mailto:terms@marmalade.ai\">terms@marmalade.ai</a>\n</p>\n<br/>          <p>\n            Last reviewed: <time dateTime=\"2025-9-16\">September 16, 2025.</time>\n          </p>\n\n</div>\n</article>\n</main>\n</Layout>\n);\n}\n\nexport default TermsAndConditions;\n\n"],"names":["navLinkItem","navLinkText","Header","React","className","src","alt","class","onClick","navigate","Footer","Link","to","_ref","pageTitle","children","data","useStaticQuery","console","log","JSON","stringify","site","siteMetadata","title","Head","lang","charSet","name","content","TermsAndConditions","Layout","href","dateTime"],"sourceRoot":""}
