We&apos;re the company behind Marmalade AI. The original co-founders looked like this. \n              Well, maybe not the green hair. We've also learned a lot from interns. \n              Goal: open source, or maybe \"open core.\"</p>\n              <br/>\n              <p>A previous mobile CRM company was a classic Series A and grew to 40 people. \n              But it took 18 months of knocking on 60-80 VC doors. We didn&apos;t want to waste time, so we would\n              bootstrap and &quot;let investors come to us&quot; when we had <i>beta</i>. Um, yeah. \n              It took longer, people needed money, and so here we are... \n            </p>\n              <div>\n                  <StaticImage\n                    alt=\"Marmalade AI gives you a peer network.\"\n                    src=\"../../images/cartoon_image.jpg\"\n                  />\n              </div>\n\n            <br/>\n            <p class=\"mb-8\">A peer network that&apos;s relevant, automatic, and effortless?</p>\n            <p>Why do this? Well, it still seems like a good idea. It seems like it should be possible to have great peer networks, \n              learn from others, teach others, and make the world a better place.
