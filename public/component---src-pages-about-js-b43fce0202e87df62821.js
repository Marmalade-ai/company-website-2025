We started with user research into the common problems people in various  career stages and professions encounter in networking: 1) Missed opportunity: You go to an event and learn later there was someone there you should have met. 2) Staying in touch: People you know from the past have no idea what you are doing now. They could be helpful, but they don't know. 3) Inefficiency: Networking can be powerful. But there's only so much time you can put into it. We found each other through user research into networking, then connected remotely, and developed a prototype in Figma. Software development prototyping for a web subscription service was done in Vue with a GCP backend.
