<h2>Our Mission and Business Model</h2>
<br/>
<p>Our mission is to improve work by improving 
    peer groups. We offer free and paid subscriptions (&quot;products&quot;, SaaS: Software as a Service) and hope you will 
    subscribe to a paid subscription. We don't sell your data.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<br/>
<p>Marmalade AI services are provided by Marmalade AI, Inc., a Delaware corporation. 
    For more information about Marmalade AI, please visit https://www.marmalade.ai/about.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Paid Accounts</h2>
<br/>
<p><i>Billing</i>: You can upgrade your account to access paid features, which would turn your 
    account into a paid account. When you do that, we'll automatically bill you from the date 
    you convert to a paid account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation. 
    You are responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required. 
    Some countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and 
    this paragraph doesn't override these laws.</p>
    <br/>
<p><i>Refunds</i>: You may cancel your Marmalade AI paid account at any time.
 {/* (instructions on how to do that are [TBD] <b>here</b>) */}
 Refunds are issued if required by law.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Downgrades</i>: Your paid account will remain in effect until it's canceled or terminated 
under these terms. If you don't pay for your paid account on time, we reserve the right to 
suspend it or reduce your access to the free version of our products.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Free trials</i>: Marmalade AI may offer a free trial membership. If you are using a free trial 
membership and cancel it before the end of the trial period, all your rights to any remaining 
free trial period will end. Typically, we will only offer one free 
trial per user.</p> 
<br/>
<p><i>Changes</i>: We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice before 
those changes take effect. Any change in prices will apply to your next billing cycle.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Your Ownership of Your Data and the Limited Permissions You Give Us</h2>
<br/>
<p><b>User Content</b> refers to the text and documents you enter, upload, and transmit when 
you use our products.</p>
<br/>
<p>You own your User Content; Marmalade AI doesn't own it. To provide our products to you, we need your 
permission (in legal language, a license) to use your User Content.</p>
<br/>
<p>You grant us a license to your User Content for the limited purposes of:</p>
<br/>
<p>
<ul>
<li>&#x2713; Operating, providing, improving, troubleshooting, and debugging our products (for example, 
your User Content may help train our suggestion engine);</li>
<li>&#x2713; Protecting our products (for example, to analyze patterns in usage to prevent abuse);</li>
<li>&#x2713; Customizing our products (for example, to create personalized suggestions for you);</li>
<li>&#x2713; Developing new products or features; and</li>
<li>&#x2713; Using information you upload or provide to us (such as your name) to encourage other 
    people in your organization or network to join Marmalade AI.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p>The license you give us is only for the above purposes. That means we will not, for example, sell 
or license your User Content to third-party data brokers.</p>
<br/>
<p>The license you grant us is:
<ul>
<li>&#x2713; Worldwide (so you can access your User Content from anywhere in the world);</li>
<li>&#x2713; Non-exclusive (meaning you own your User Content and can also license it to other people 
    or companies);</li>
<li>&#x2713; Royalty-free (meaning we don't pay you for it); and</li>
<li>&#x2713; For as long as intellectual property laws protect your User Content.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>
<p>The license you give us allows us to—solely for the purposes outlined above—store, reproduce,
    use, publish, and publicly display (to show your User Content to you), modify, and create 
    derivative works of (such as providing writing suggestions and autocorrecting words) your 
    User Content. The license you give us also permits our service providers to assist us in 
    doing this. </p>
    <br/>
<p>Marmalade AI does not own, control, verify, or endorse User Content. You are responsible for 
    all of your User Content. That means you should back up all your User Content and not do 
    anything illegal or harmful with it (including violate any intellectual property or 
    trade secret laws).</p>
    <br/>
<h2>Our Intellectual Property Rights and License to You</h2>
<br/>
<p>Some of our products allow you to download client software. So long as you comply with these terms, 
we give you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use our client software 
solely to access the products.</p>
<br/>
<p>Our products are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. Except for this limited license, 
we reserve all right, title, and interest in our products, trademarks, logos, and other brand features. 
We welcome feedback, and you agree that we can use that feedback without restriction or any obligation 
o you.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Your Use of Generative AI</h2>
<br/>
<p>Additional terms apply when you use Marmalade AI's generative AI services and features.</p>
<br/>
<p>
<i>Generated Content</i>. You may use generative AI features to submit inputs and receive generated outputs. 
When you use generative AI features, the inputs and outputs are your User Data. You are responsible 
for your User Data and will not use Marmalade AI's generative AI features in a way that infringes, 
violates, or misappropriates any of our rights or the rights of any third party. You acknowledge 
that due to the nature of machine learning and the technology powering generative AI, outputs may 
not be unique and Marmalade AI may generate the same or similar output for third parties.</p>
<br/>
<p>
<i>Usage Limits</i>. Depending on your subscription plan, you may have a limit on your use of 
Marmalade AI's generative AI features. You acknowledge and agree that if you exceed the usage limit 
allotted by your subscription plan: (i) you may be required to purchase additional usage to continue 
accessing and using generative AI assistance and (ii) Marmalade AI may suspend or degrade performance 
of the generative AI features. You acknowledge that any purchased usage for generative AI assistance 
is tied to your Marmalade AI subscription plan, and account termination will invalidate any remaining 
purchased usage.</p>
<br/>
<p>
<i>Usage Restrictions</i>. You may not use Marmalade AI's generative AI features:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>&#x2713; To develop foundation or large language models that compete with Marmalade AI;</li> 
<li>&#x2713; To mislead any third party that any output from Marmalade AI's generative AI was solely human generated;</li>
<li>&#x2713; In a manner that violates these terms, Marmalade AI documentation, usage guidelines, or our Acceptable 
Use Policy.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Limitations on Use and Responsibilities</h2>
<br/>
<p><i>Acceptable Use Policy</i>. You must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy when you use our products.</p> 
<br/>
<p><i>Keeping your account information up to date and safe</i>. You are responsible for safeguarding your 
password to our products. Don't share your account credentials or give others access to your account. 
We will use your account email address to contact you about our products, so you must ensure that your 
account information stays current.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Minimum age requirements</i>. To use our products, you must be at least 13 if you reside in the United 
States and 16 if you reside anywhere else. If the law where you reside requires that you are older 
for us to lawfully provide our products to you without parental consent (including using your 
information), you must be that age. You may not use our products if you don't meet these age 
requirements. However, if your parents or guardians have allowed you to join a Marmalade AI for 
Education team, you may still use our products.</p> 
<br/>
<h2>Termination</h2>
<br/>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our products with notice to 
    you if:</p>
    <br/>
<p>(a) you have breached these terms or our Acceptable Use Policy,</p>
<p>(b) you use the products in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to other 
Marmalade AI users or us, or</p>
<p>(c) you don't have a paid account and haven't accessed our products for 12 consecutive months.</p>
<br/>
<p>Before suspending or terminating your account, we'll (1) provide you with reasonable advance 
    notice via the email address associated with your account so you can try to remedy the activity 
    that prompted us to contact you and (2) allow you to export your documents from our products. If 
    you fail to take the steps we ask of you after such notice, we'll terminate or suspend your access 
    to our products.</p>
    <br/>
<p>We won't provide notice before termination where we believe that:</p>
<br/>
<p>(a) you're in material breach of these terms or our Acceptable Use Policy,</p>
<p>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide our products to our 
other users, or</p>
<p>(c) the law prohibits us from providing notice.</p>
<br/>
<p>When this agreement terminates for any reason, all the sections one would expect to survive will 
    survive, including, but not limited to, “Warranty Disclaimers,” “Limitation of Liability,” 
    Resolving Disputes,” “Miscellaneous Legal Terms,” “Our Intellectual Property Rights and License,” 
    and “Paid Accounts.” The termination of this agreement doesn't affect any amounts owed before that 
    termination. </p>
    <br/>
<h2>Discontinuation and Modification of Products</h2>
<br/>
<p>We are continually changing and improving our products, and we may add or remove features or 
    functionality. If we discontinue a product, where reasonably possible we will give you reasonable 
    advance notice and a chance to download your stored User Content.</p>
    <br/>
<h2>Open Source Software, Reverse Engineering, and Automatic Updates</h2>
<br/>
<p>To the extent any component of our Software may be offered under open-source license terms that 
    we make available to you, see [<b>TBD</b>] here for a list of the open-source software that we use. The 
    provisions of open-source licenses may expressly override some of these terms. </p>
    <br/>
<p>Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or 
decompile our products, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so. Our products may update 
themselves automatically to ensure you're using the latest version.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Third-Party Websites</h2>
<br/>
<p>Any links to third-party websites or apps are provided for your convenience only and are subject to 
the third party's terms. Marmalade AI isn't responsible or liable for those websites, products, or 
services.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Beta Products</h2>
<br/>
<p>We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. We will mark 
these products with the words “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or 
phrases with similar meanings). If you decide to use them, please remember that they may not be as 
reliable or as thoroughly tested as our other products. To improve and evaluate these products, we 
will log and analyze information about how you use and interact with them.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Warranty Disclaimers</h2>
<br/>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, Marmalade AI, ITS AFFILIATES, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS 
    AND DISTRIBUTORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “Marmalade AI ENTITIES”), EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL 
    WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
    ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A 
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING, 
    LAW, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE, OR REGARDING SECURITY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND 
    PERFORMANCE. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN SOLE RISK AND THAT OUR PRODUCTS 
    ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS,” “WHERE IS,” “AS AVAILABLE,” “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES 
    DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF OUR PRODUCTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED 
    OR ERROR-FREE. Marmalade AI'S AFFILIATES AND THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES' SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND 
    DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS SECTION.</p>
    <br/>
<p>THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING THE OUTPUTS THAT MAY BE GENERATED FROM USE 
OF GENERATIVE AI FEATURES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FACTUAL ACCURACY OF ANY OUTPUTS OR SUITABILITY 
FOR YOUR USE CASE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF ANY GENERATIVE AI OUTPUTS IS DONE AT YOUR 
SOLE RISK. DUE TO THE NATURE OF GENERATIVE TECHNOLOGY, YOU SHOULD NOT RELY ON Marmalade AI'S 
GENERATIVE AI AS A SINGLE SOURCE OF FACTUAL INFORMATION. NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE, WHETHER ORAL OR 
WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM OR THROUGH Marmalade AI SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE 
HEREIN.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
<br/>
<p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE LIABILITY LIMITATIONS ARE ALLOWED, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES 
    BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS FOR (I) ANY AMOUNT IN THE AGGREGATE IN EXCESS OF THE FEES 
    YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID TO THE Marmalade AI ENTITIES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY 
    PRECEDING THE EVENT(S) GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY; (II) ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST OR DAMAGED 
    CONTENT OR OTHER DATA, OR FAILURE TO MEET ANY DUTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION GOOD FAITH AND 
    REASONABLE CARE; OR (III) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
    DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER.</p>
    <br/>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND IS A 
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Marmalade AI AND YOU. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 
OUR PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE PROVIDED WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS.</p>
<br/>
<p>Certain countries and states don't allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this 
    limitation of liability may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights. In that case, 
    you agree that the Marmalade AI Entities' liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible 
    in your country of residence.</p>
    <br/>
<p>IF ANY PORTION OF THESE SECTIONS IS HELD TO BE INVALID, THE INVALIDITY OF SUCH PORTION SHALL NOT 
AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THESE TERMS. Marmalade AI'S AFFILIATES AND THE 
Marmalade AI ENTITIES' SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF 
HIS SECTION.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Resolving Disputes</h2>
<br/>
<p>Before filing a claim against Marmalade AI, you agree to try 
    to resolve the dispute informally by contacting <a href="mailto:support@marmalade.ai">support@marmalade.ai</a>. 
    We'll try to resolve 
    the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If you and we cannot resolve the dispute 
    informally, then a party seeking to bring a formal proceeding must first send to the other, by 
    certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to Marmalade AI should be sent 
    to 10 Dobbs St, Bernardsville, NJ 07924, Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must 
    (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief 
    sought. If Marmalade AI and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after 
    receiving the Notice, you or Marmalade AI may commence a formal proceeding. </p>
    <br/>
<p>Judicial forum for disputes. You and Marmalade AI agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims 
relating to these terms for our products will be brought in the federal or state courts of Somerset  
County, New Jersey, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below. Both you and Marmalade AI 
consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts. If you reside in a country with laws that 
give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member 
states), this paragraph doesn't affect those requirements.</p>
<br/>
<h3>IF YOU'RE A U.S. RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h3>
<br/>
<p><i>We both agree to arbitrate</i>. You and Marmalade AI agree to resolve any claims relating to these terms 
or our products through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth 
under “Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate” below. This includes disputes arising out of or relating 
to interpretation or application of this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including its 
enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Opt-out of agreement to arbitrate</i>. You have the right to opt out of these arbitration provisions (and 
any future changes to arbitration provisions) by emailing [<b>TBD</b>] arbitration-opt-out@marmalade.ai within 
30 days of agreeing to a version of these terms containing arbitration terms (however, if you agreed 
to a previous version of these terms of service that contain an arbitration provision, you are still 
bound by those arbitration provisions).</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Arbitration procedures</i>. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under 
its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The 
arbitration will be held in Somerset County, New Jersey, or any other location we agree to. During 
the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Marmalade AI or you shall not be disclosed 
to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Marmalade AI 
is entitled.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Arbitration fees and incentives</i>. The AAA rules will govern the payment of all arbitration fees. 
Marmalade AI will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for non-frivolous claims less 
than $75,000. Marmalade AI will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the 
arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate</i>. Either you or Marmalade AI may assert claims, if they qualify, in 
small claims court in Somerset County, New Jersey, or any United States county where you live or 
work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse 
of the products or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, 
or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process 
described above. If the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree 
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Somerset County, New Jersey, 
to resolve your claim.</p>
<br/>
<h3>NO CLASS ACTIONS.</h3> 
<br/>
<p>You may only resolve disputes with us individually. That is, you may not 
bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. 
Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other 
arbitrations aren't allowed.</p>
<br/>
<p><i>Severability</i>. If the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this 
“Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section will be deemed void. If you are found to have a non-waivable 
right to bring a specific claim or request a specific form of relief that an arbitrator lacks the 
authority to redress or award under this “Mandatory Arbitration Provisions” section, including public 
injunctive relief, then only that particular claim or request may be brought in court, and you and we 
agree that litigation of this claim or request will be stayed pending the resolution of any other 
claims or requests for relief in arbitration.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Controlling Law</h3>
<br/>
<p>New Jersey law will govern these terms except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some 
countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by 
the local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<br/>
<p>These terms make up the entire agreement between you and Marmalade AI, Inc., regarding your use of 
our products. They supersede any prior agreements.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Waiver, Severability, and Assignment</h3>
<br/>
<p>Marmalade AI's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a 
provision (other than the “NO CLASS ACTIONS” paragraph) is unenforceable, the remaining provisions 
will remain in full effect, and an enforceable term will be substituted with the goal of reflecting 
our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under these 
terms, and any such attempt will be void. Marmalade AI may assign its rights to any of its affiliates 
or subsidiaries or any successor in interest of any business associated with the products.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Modifications to These Terms</h3>
<br/>
<p>From time to time, we may revise these terms to, for example, reflect changes to the law, new 
regulations, and changes to our products.</p>
<br/>
<p>If an update significantly negatively affects your use of our products or your legal rights as a user 
of our products, we'll notify you before the update's effective date by sending an email to the email 
address associated with your account or via an in-product notification. We will give you at least 30 
days after that notice before the update takes effect. </p>
<br/>
<p>We may also update these terms in ways that won't significantly negatively affect your rights. For 
example, we may change the feature or product names or change the email address you can use to 
contact us. In those cases, we will post the change to our website and link to the previous version. </p>
<br/>
<p>If you don't agree to the updates we make, you must cancel your account before they become effective. 
Where required, we'll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for our 
products and your account cancellation date. By using or accessing the products after the updates 
come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
