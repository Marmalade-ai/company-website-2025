      Nice would be: just have a profile, and automatically create a peer group based on tahat. That is
      what the Marmalade AI app does. In beta, for specialists in UX design, digital marketing, and machine learning, it 
      peer groups for people who really need to connect to each other to stay up-to-date. Traditional
      networking (through meetups, one-on-ones, or services like Linkedin, TopTal, UpWork, or Indeed
      are not all that useful. They're also too expensive and time-consuming. Using your profile, 
      Marmalade AI runs cloud functions to create a peer group for you. When, where, and with who you connect is under your 
      control. Marmalade AI is a subscription web-based service in the U.S. on phones, laptops, and desktops."
